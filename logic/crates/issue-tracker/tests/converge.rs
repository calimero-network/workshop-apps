//! Convergence coverage for the issue-tracker service.
//!
//! `IssueTracker` hand-writes `Mergeable`/`RekeyTarget` on its `Issue` map value
//! (it nests several `LwwRegister`s), so this is the #2577 case: without
//! deterministic re-keying the nested registers would be last-writer-wins'd as
//! an opaque blob. We register the generated re-key thunks
//! (`__calimero_register_rekey()`) so each nested register gets a deterministic
//! id and converges as a child entity, then assert every replica lands on the
//! same Merkle root.
//!
//! Surface under test: the `issues: UnorderedMap<String, Issue>` field. It (and
//! the `comments`/`labels` maps) are all plain `UnorderedMap`s — there is no
//! `AuthoredMap`/`SharedStorage` in state, so the bare `converge_app` harness
//! (which has no signing identity) can reconcile every field. We still seed the
//! issue at genesis (single identity) and drive only `set_status`, which touches
//! the `issues` map, to keep the test focused on the nested-register merge.
//!
//! `#[serial]`: `converge_app` clears/repopulates the process-global merge
//! registry per run. Own integration binary so it is isolated from the
//! in-`lib.rs` `TestHost` unit tests.
